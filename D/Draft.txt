Space Requirements per Node:
x USED + y FREE; x >= 0; y >= x


Replication Priority:
- Most recent/old
- Larger/smaller


Replication:
- Split into chunks and send each one to each successor.
    chunk = x / m
- Upon receiving blocks distribute them (along with existing ones) on the
  available space. Send remaining ones (full or partial) to the successors.
    available_n = (x + y) * (block_n / ∑ block_n); n ∈ [1, p]; p <= m


Replication:
- Key's node: original copy.
- Finger nodes: master copies.
- ?: secondary copies.
